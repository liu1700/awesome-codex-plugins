# Han Hu Research-Writing Style

Use this reference for manuscripts authored or supervised by Han Hu and when the user explicitly asks to match Han Hu's established research-writing style. Apply these preferences after the domain and integrity checks in the main skill. When a private style-calibration corpus is available, also use [han-hu-style-calibration-protocol.md](han-hu-style-calibration-protocol.md); its evidence labels control which exemplars may be treated as accepted-author text.

## Stable Style Primitives

- Start from the mechanical or thermal-fluid problem, coupled physics, and multiscale difficulty before introducing AI, software, or data infrastructure.
- Treat AI/ML as a means to measure, interpret, reconstruct, predict, or organize physical behavior rather than the final scientific point.
- Frame laboratory resources as case studies or seed efforts within a balanced field-wide ecosystem.
- Write connected technical paragraphs with one central purpose. Avoid choppy sentence strings, rhetorical self-questioning, excessive colon clauses, and editorial or promotional commentary.
- State the technical finding, mechanism, limitation, or need directly. Use `indicates` for supported interpretation, `suggests` for weaker inference, and `demonstrates` only for direct evidence.
- Make figures, tables, and equations carry the argument. Give related figures distinct roles in the prose.
- Prefer concise final communication, but do not reduce scientific depth for a high-risk audit, review, or revision.
- Use professional publication language without casual expressions, reader guidance, prompt-like statements, or meta-commentary about wording. State the technical meaning directly.
- Avoid excessive colons and semicolons. Prefer connected complete sentences, using i), ii), and iii) for compact enumerations when needed.
- Avoid one-sentence paragraphs and strings of very short paragraphs. Each paragraph should develop one central topic through evidence, interpretation, and implication.
- Use short noun phrases for section titles. Do not place conclusions in headings.
- Refer to subfigures as `Fig. 6a`, `Fig. 6b`, and so forth. Do not use "panel" in manuscript text or captions.

Use [paper-writing-style.md](paper-writing-style.md) for paper structure, [literature-review.md](literature-review.md) for synthesis, and [manuscript-revision-submission.md](manuscript-revision-submission.md) for revision/submission details. Do not duplicate their checklists here.

## Figure And Caption Preferences

- Use Arial for all figure text unless the target journal explicitly requires another typeface. Keep font sizes legible and consistent at final publication dimensions.
- Italicize variable symbols. Keep units and subscript or superscript descriptors in roman type unless a mathematical convention or journal rule requires otherwise.
- Place subfigure labels `(a)`, `(b)`, and so forth outside the plotting box near the upper-left corner, aligned just above the y-axis label and level with the top of the axes with a small cushion, when the journal layout permits.
- Give every subplot a unique sequential label. Remove excessive whitespace and prevent labels, legends, annotations, and data from overlapping.
- Write descriptive captions as continuous prose. Identify the quantities, conditions, subfigure mapping, visual encodings, uncertainty treatment, and data-reduction choices without using the word "panel."
- Discuss figures with enough detail to identify both axes, the experimental or modeled conditions, the principal observation, and the physical interpretation.
- Use publication-facing operating conditions rather than internal case IDs. Use author-year labels for individual literature datasets.
- Do not use a generic corner uncertainty marker unless it is explicitly requested and its meaning is unambiguous.

## Manuscript Revision Calibration

When revising a manuscript to match this style, preserve the scientific evidence while strengthening the connection from engineering need to mechanism, method, result, and bounded implication. Revise the section and paragraph structure before making sentence-level edits; generic simplification alone is insufficient.

- Make the abstract evidence-dense. When the data support it, include two to three principal quantitative findings rather than incidental experimental detail, then state what the result enables within its tested scope.
- Synthesize the literature by application, architecture, material, diagnostic method, or modeling approach. Distinguish adjacent approaches from the specific remaining gap; do not claim that no prior work exists when relevant neighboring work exists.
- Define experimental and model boundaries explicitly: system boundary, coordinate convention, imposed and inferred quantities, calibration, uncertainty, and the distinction between a fitted effective property and an intrinsic constituent property.
- Treat every principal result as a figure-led argument: orient the reader, report the quantitative observation, relate it to the physical architecture or mechanism, and give the design implication.
- Place each caveat near the claim it bounds. Identify the relevant unmeasured quantity, uncertain boundary, untested condition, or model-form limitation once, rather than repeating generic defensive qualifications throughout the manuscript.
- Use two to four numbered conclusions for multi-result papers. Each conclusion should state the finding, physical interpretation, and bounded implication, not merely restate a section heading.
- Do not resolve a substantive evidence gap by weakening prose alone. Identify the additional analysis, validation, or measurement required and preserve uncertainty and provenance in the final manuscript.

## Reviews Of Data, Software, And Benchmarks

- Organize by mechanism, modality, dimensionality, task, evidence maturity, and unresolved gap rather than author chronology.
- Use spatial-plus-temporal dimensionality when it helps organize multimodal data; do not force the taxonomy onto unrelated work.
- Connect data classes to plausible analysis or ML tasks and the physical quantities they expose.
- Treat initial benchmark releases as seed benchmarks and collaborative mechanisms unless coverage, governance, baselines, and external validation support a field-standard claim.
- Make physics metadata central: geometry, fluid/material, operating conditions, calibration, synchronization, uncertainty, data reduction, and useful dimensionless groups.
- Separate author-generated availability from third-party resources and avoid one-lab dominance.

Use [dataset-software-review.md](dataset-software-review.md) and [data-provenance-and-release.md](data-provenance-and-release.md) for the detailed workflows.

## Citation And Submission Habits

- Use `FirstAuthor et al.` in prose and avoid long author-chain labels.
- Verify citation intent after structural edits, especially numeric references, permissions, datasets, and software.
- Highlight only changed phrases, clauses, or sentences in marked manuscripts.
- Make reviewer responses complete enough to stand alone and include specific changes and locations.
- Keep one active Overleaf entry point and remove stale alternate source files from production packages.

Use [citation-integrity.md](citation-integrity.md) and [manuscript-revision-submission.md](manuscript-revision-submission.md) for the authoritative procedures.
