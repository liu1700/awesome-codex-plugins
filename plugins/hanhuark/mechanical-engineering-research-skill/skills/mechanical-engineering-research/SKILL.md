# Mechanical Engineering Research

## Core Workflow

1. Define the engineering decision or research question.
   - Identify the system, geometry, materials or fluid, operating regime, boundary and initial conditions, outputs, constraints, and intended user.
   - Ask only for missing information that materially changes scientific validity or the work path. Otherwise state bounded assumptions and proceed.

2. Classify the evidence before interpreting it.
   - Label important inputs and results as measured, reported, simulated, derived, assumed, inferred, illustrative, screening-level, proposed, or independently validated.
   - Preserve source identity, applicability, uncertainty, and limitations. Treat search results and AI summaries as discovery aids, not evidence.

3. Establish the technical invariants.
   - Define symbols, dimensions, units, sign conventions, coordinate frames, time bases, system boundaries, property-evaluation states, and data ordering.
   - Keep these definitions consistent across equations, code, tables, figures, and prose.

4. Select the simplest credible method.
   - Begin with analytical bounds, conservation checks, accepted correlations, or a representative baseline case.
   - Add experiments, CFD, reduced-order modeling, or AI/ML only when they answer the physical question or overcome a stated limitation.

5. Verify in proportion to claim strength and consequence.
   - Check dimensional consistency, limiting cases, conservation, uncertainty, sensitivity, repeatability, numerical convergence, validation, leakage, domain shift, and failure modes as applicable.
   - When a result changes materially, identify whether data, code, assumptions, definitions, or boundaries caused the change before treating it as a physical trend.

6. Produce and verify the actual deliverable.
   - Trace claims, equations, figures, and tables to sources, data, transformations, code, environment, and limitations.
   - Run feasible tests, compile or render documents, inspect visual artifacts, and report exactly what was and was not verified.

## Integrity Gates

- Do not repair a scientific-validity problem only by polishing or weakening prose. Revise the analysis, model, experiment, code, data, or evidence chain when required.
- Do not invent a citation, source detail, engineering input, tool result, uncertainty distribution, or completion state. Preserve an unresolved item explicitly when verification is unavailable.
- When sources conflict, compare definitions, regimes, methods, dates, and evidence quality. Prefer primary evidence and later accepted user corrections; surface consequential conflicts that remain unresolved.
- When an engineering assumption is uncertain, state it, bracket it with a sensitivity or limiting case when feasible, and explain how it affects the conclusion.
- When a required tool or source is unavailable, use a credible non-destructive alternative if one exists. Otherwise state the blocked verification and the evidence needed to complete it.
- Distinguish local edits, staged changes, commits, pushes, releases, deployments, archives, and independent review.

For document, PDF, spreadsheet, or presentation files, also use any available format-specific skill for file manipulation and rendering. Keep this skill responsible for engineering validity and scientific interpretation.

For a manuscript authored or supervised by Han Hu, read [han-hu-research-style.md](references/han-hu-research-style.md) together with the task-specific paper and figure references even when the request does not explicitly ask for style matching. When the user provides or configures a private style-calibration corpus, also read [han-hu-style-calibration-protocol.md](references/han-hu-style-calibration-protocol.md), retrieve only genre-matched evidence, and report the evidence status of the exemplars used.

For iterative peer-review work, use `reviewer-author-loop` as the process scaffold when available. Apply this skill to physics, equations, instrumentation, uncertainty, data reduction, figures, modeling assumptions, and claim support.

## Output Contract

- Lead with the engineering answer, finding, or decision.
- State material assumptions, definitions, units, validity ranges, and evidence class.
- Explain the governing mechanism and compare credible alternatives or bounds.
- Report uncertainty, validation, failure modes, and residual risk at the level needed by the claim.
- Provide traceable artifacts and exact verification results when files or code are involved.
- End with the smallest useful next calculation, experiment, simulation, source check, or author decision.
