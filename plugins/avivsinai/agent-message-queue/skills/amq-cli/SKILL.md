  Coordinate agents via the AMQ CLI for file-based inter-agent messaging. Use
  this skill whenever you need to send messages to another agent (codex, claude,
  or any named handle), check your inbox, drain queued messages, set up co-op
  mode between agents, join a swarm team, route messages across projects, or
  diagnose delivery issues. Also use it when you receive a message and need to
  know how to reply, inspect receipts, or handle priority. Covers any multi-agent
  coordination task where agents need to talk to each other — review requests,
  questions, status updates, decision threads, wake notifications, and
  orchestrator integration (Symphony, Kanban). For collaborative spec/design
  workflows specifically, prefer the /amq-spec skill which provides structured
  phase-by-phase guidance. Not intended for distributed systems design
  (RabbitMQ, Kafka), CI/CD pipelines, or single-agent tasks with no partner.

# AMQ CLI Skill

File-based message queue for agent-to-agent coordination.

AMQ manages the conversation, not the task plan. Use it for messaging, routing, replies, and adapter-emitted lifecycle events; keep work decomposition and execution in the orchestrator above it.

## Prerequisites

Requires `amq` binary in PATH. Install:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avivsinai/agent-message-queue/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

## Environment Rules

AMQ primarily uses `AM_ROOT` (which mailbox tree) and `AM_ME` (which agent).
Pinned terminals also carry `AM_BASE_ROOT` plus an independent `AM_SESSION`
identity; sessionless pins use the exact root as `AM_BASE_ROOT` and an empty
`AM_SESSION`. Getting these wrong means messages go to the wrong place or
silently disappear, so let the CLI handle them rather than guessing.

**Inside `coop exec`** — everything is pre-configured. Just run bare commands:
```bash
amq send --to codex --body "hello"     # correct
amq send --me claude --to codex ...    # wrong — --me overrides the env
./amq send ...                         # wrong — use amq from PATH
```
The reason: `coop exec` sets `AM_ROOT`, `AM_ME`, `AM_BASE_ROOT`, and
`AM_SESSION` precisely for the session. Passing `--me` overrides the identity;
for read-side sibling access, use `--session <name>` instead of overriding the
raw root.

**Outside `coop exec`** — resolve the root from config, don't hardcode it:
```bash
amq_context="$(amq env --me claude)" && eval "$amq_context"  # reads .amqrc chain, replaces the full context
amq_context="$(amq env --session auth --me claude --export)" && eval "$amq_context"  # pin one session

# Or use an isolated subshell without polluting the parent shell:
(
  amq_context="$(amq env --me claude)" &&
  eval "$amq_context" &&
  amq send --to codex --body "hello"
)
```
Why not hardcode? The root path depends on project and explicit configuration,
then context-sensitive implicit fallbacks. Hardcoding skips this and breaks
when the project moves or config changes.
Every shell-mode `amq env` invocation replaces the complete context. It emits
`AM_SESSION` unconditionally (empty for a sessionless root), exports
`AM_BASE_ROOT` as the authorized parent for named sessions or the exact root for
a sessionless context.
`--export` additionally prints a stderr pin note. Treat the evaluated output as
one terminal, one session.

**Global fallback**: Orchestrator-spawned agents often start outside an
AMQ-enabled repo where no project `.amqrc` or repo-local `.agent-mail` exists.
Set `AMQ_GLOBAL_ROOT` or `~/.amqrc` so `amq env` and `amq doctor` still resolve
the correct queue. `AMQ_GLOBAL_ROOT` is explicit authority and therefore
precedes repo-local auto-detection. The implicit home config is ineligible
inside a Git worktree or bare repository.
A Git worktree or bare repository with no eligible root refuses implicit
`~/.amqrc` fallback because it can silently select another project's mailbox.
Participating commands keep that refusal. `coop exec` honors root precedence,
then bootstraps a worktree-local queue at the Git top when no eligible root
exists; `coop exec --no-init` refuses. `coop init` explicitly targets that local
Git top. Bare repositories require a worktree or an explicit `--root`.

**Session pitfall**: Selector-free `coop exec` uses the declared `default_session` from `.amq/launch.json`, or `collab` (i.e., `.agent-mail/collab`). Outside `coop exec`, the base root is `.agent-mail` (no session suffix). These are different mailbox trees — don't mix them up.

### Root Resolution Truth-Table

| Context | Command | AM_ROOT resolves to |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| Outside `coop exec` | `amq env --me claude` | resolved base root from project `.amqrc`, `AMQ_GLOBAL_ROOT`, or an eligible implicit fallback |
| Git worktree or bare repository, no project `.amqrc` | `amq env --me claude` | `AMQ_GLOBAL_ROOT` when set, otherwise repo-local detected `.agent-mail` |
| Git worktree or bare repository, no eligible root | `amq env --session auth --me claude` | refuses implicit `~/.amqrc`; requires a local or explicit root |
| Git worktree, no eligible root | `amq coop exec claude` | bootstraps `<git-top>/.agent-mail/collab`; never consults `~/.amqrc` |
| Git worktree, no eligible root | `amq coop exec --session auth claude` | bootstraps `<git-top>/.agent-mail/auth` |
| Git worktree, no eligible root | `amq coop exec --no-init claude` | refuses and names `amq coop init` as the remedy |
| Bare repository, no eligible root | `amq coop exec claude` | refuses; use a worktree or explicit `--root` |
| Outside `coop exec`, isolated session | `amq env --session auth --me claude` | `<resolved-base-root>/auth` |
| Inside `coop exec` (no flags) | automatic | `.agent-mail/collab` (default session) |
| Inside `coop exec --session X` | automatic | `.agent-mail/X` |

Canonical root precedence is:

```text
explicit --root > AM_ROOT > project-local .amqrc > AMQ_GLOBAL_ROOT > implicit fallbacks
```

Inside a Git worktree or bare repository, the remaining eligible fallback is repo-local detected
`.agent-mail`; outside Git, `~/.amqrc` precedes detected `.agent-mail`.

An initialized cwd-local queue is also a routing safety signal. If an active
pin points to another root, implicit participating commands refuse instead of
silently following that pin. Repin to the cwd-local queue, route deliberately
with `--session`/`--project`, or pass an explicit `--root` to confirm the
active queue; ordinary pin checks still apply.

### Git worktrees

A relative project root such as `{"root":".agent-mail"}` and auto-detected
roots are intentionally per-worktree. Two terminals in different git
worktrees can therefore use the same session name while reading different
mailboxes. If a delivery receipt times out, run `amq doctor --ops`; it can warn
when a peer has fresher presence in the same session under another worktree.

To share one mailbox across worktrees, use the same absolute root in each
worktree's machine-local `.amqrc`, or remove the project-relative `.amqrc` and
set `AMQ_GLOBAL_ROOT` to one absolute base. Keep the relative default when
per-worktree isolation is intended. A Git worktree with neither local
configuration nor a local queue fails closed instead of inheriting
`~/.amqrc`; this prevents accidental cross-project delivery.

## Task Routing

Before diving in, match the task to the right workflow — this avoids wasted effort:

| Your task | What to do |
|-----------|-----------|
| **"spec", "design with", "collaborative spec"** | Use `/amq-spec` instead — it has structured phase-by-phase guidance for parallel-research workflows. |
| **Send a message, review request, question** | Use `amq send` (see Messaging below) |
| **Buzz / ACP / `amq-acp`** | Companion `amq-acp` queues to `AMQ_ACP_TO`; pool workers must not drain. Chat must not pass `--root`, recipients, or argv. `[Context]` is not routing. See [`cmd/amq-acp/README.md`](../../cmd/amq-acp/README.md). |
| **Two-host / Grok computer / `amq-bridge`** | Companion `amq-bridge`, never a foreign `--root`. See Two-host fleets below. |
| **Swarm / agent teams** | Read [references/swarm-mode.md](references/swarm-mode.md), then use `amq swarm` |
| **Received message with labels `workflow:spec`** | Follow the spec skill protocol: do independent research first, then engage on the `spec/<topic>` thread — don't skip straight to implementation. |

## Quick Start

The repository [README Getting started](https://github.com/avivsinai/agent-message-queue#getting-started)
is the canonical human onboarding path. The commands below keep the agent
workflow self-contained.

```bash
# Interactive one-time project setup
amq setup

# Non-interactive setup: re-pass the same explicit inputs on preview and apply
setup_args=(--agents claude,codex --default-session collab --launcher-preference commands)
setup_preview="$(amq setup --preview --json "${setup_args[@]}")"
setup_digest="$(printf '%s\n' "$setup_preview" | jq -r '.preview.digest')"
amq setup --apply "$setup_digest" "${setup_args[@]}"

# Daily entry: reconcile the declared session (never creates an unknown name)
amq launch
amq session create feature-x   # once, before the first named-session launch
amq launch --session feature-x
amq session resume feature-x
```

`setup --preview` performs zero writes. On a fresh non-interactive setup,
`--agents`, `--default-session`, and `--launcher-preference` are required.
`--apply` recomputes the preview and exits `6` without writes unless the
approved `sha256:<hex>` digest matches. It is mutually exclusive with `-y`;
`--preview` is also mutually exclusive with `-y`.

For Cursor, setup uses the current `agent` command when it is on `PATH`; if it
is absent, the preview explains that setup is falling back to legacy
`cursor-agent`.

Grok Build is supported by the managed launch adapter. It mints an exact
`--session-id` from the AMQ launch nonce and resumes only with the stored
`--resume <UUID>`; `--continue`, `--always-approve`, and `--yolo` are rejected
from committed launch arguments. Grok tool policy uses its canonical
`--tools` and `--disallowed-tools` flags; do not translate those values through
Claude's `--allowedTools` grammar.

Put provider flags in the committed `.amq/launch.json` `command` arrays. The
launcher validates them and includes them in the semantic trust digest. The
first semantic plan, and each plan change, needs an interactive trust
confirmation stored outside the worktree. Non-interactive or `--json` calls
exit `6` until that digest is trusted. An unknown `session resume` name exits
`3` and writes nothing. Registered launchers are `commands`, `tmux`, `cmux`,
and `ghostty`. `--launcher auto` walks the local preference; an explicit
`--launcher <name>` wins. Inside cmux (`CMUX_SURFACE_ID`) is preferred over
inside Ghostty (`TERM_PROGRAM=ghostty`). Setup lists cmux and Ghostty as
available only when Detect ping succeeds, not from LookPath alone. The
`commands` backend prints complete `coop exec` commands and exits `6` because
running them is the remaining operator action. Paste the emitted lines exactly,
one per terminal; do not reconstruct them from generic `coop exec` examples.
Managed `tmux`, `cmux`, and `ghostty` backends run the plan in-app instead.

Without `--session` or `--root`, `coop exec` uses the declared `default_session` from `.amq/launch.json`, or `collab` when none is declared. Creating a missing session or root from `coop exec` is deprecated and prints `warning: creating a missing session or root from coop exec is deprecated; use 'amq session create <name>' or 'amq init --root'. The next major release makes this exit 3.`

Add `--no-gitignore` when `coop exec` should auto-initialize the project without changing `.gitignore`.

Direct `coop exec` is legacy low-level plumbing. When an operator deliberately
uses it, provider flags follow `--`; dangerous bypass flags belong only on this
operator-controlled path and are rejected from committed launch arguments:

```bash
amq coop exec claude -- --dangerously-skip-permissions
amq coop exec codex -- --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox
amq coop exec grok
```

### Standalone wake interrupt safety

Standalone wake keeps urgent interrupt notices and the bell without injecting
Ctrl+C by default:
```bash
amq wake --me claude --interrupt-cmd none &
```

Swarm bridge events are hardcoded `priority=normal` plus label `swarm`, so do
not bind that combination to Ctrl+C. Use ordinary non-destructive wake:
```bash
amq wake --me codex --interrupt-cmd none &
```

`--interrupt-cmd ctrl-c` sends a real SIGINT to the foreground process group
and can interrupt or crash the agent. Use it only with a separate,
operator-controlled label/priority when process-level interruption is
intentional; the `interrupt` label alone never enables Ctrl+C.

## Statusline (Claude Code)

To show the current AMQ session in your Claude Code status bar, add this snippet to your statusline script (e.g., `~/.claude/statusline.sh`):

```bash
# AMQ session segment — try CLI first, fall back to env vars for older amq versions
amq_session=""
if _amq_out=$(amq env --session-name 2>/dev/null) && [ -n "$_amq_out" ]; then
    amq_session="$_amq_out"
elif [ -n "$AM_ROOT" ] && [ -n "$AM_BASE_ROOT" ] && [ "$AM_ROOT" != "$AM_BASE_ROOT" ]; then
    amq_session=$(basename "$AM_ROOT")
fi
if [ -n "$amq_session" ]; then
    output+=$(printf " | \033[33mamq:%s\033[0m" "$amq_session")
fi
```

`amq env --session-name` (v0.27+) prints the session name and exits 0 (empty when not in a session). The env-var fallback covers older versions. `amq env --json` also includes `session_name`.

To also set the terminal tab title (works in Ghostty, iTerm2, Terminal.app):

```bash
# Set tab title to "repo | amq:session" — re-asserts on each statusline refresh.
# Manual titles (e.g. Ghostty's prompt_tab_title) take priority and won't be overwritten.
tab_title="$repo_name"
[ -n "$amq_session" ] && tab_title+=" | amq:${amq_session}"
printf '\033]0;%s\007' "$tab_title" > /dev/tty 2>/dev/null
```

## Integration & Ops Quick Reference

```bash
# Global fallback for orchestrator-spawned agents
export AMQ_GLOBAL_ROOT="$HOME/.agent-mail"

# Symphony hooks
amq integration symphony init --me codex
amq integration symphony emit --event after_run --me codex

# Cline Kanban bridge
amq integration kanban bridge --me codex
amq integration kanban bridge --me codex --workspace-id my-workspace

# Runtime diagnostics
amq doctor --ops
amq doctor --ops --json
amq doctor --root <exact-root> --ops
amq wake check --me <agent>
amq wake check --me <agent> --json

# Base-config-only session repair outside the current pin
amq doctor --root <session-root> --base-root <base-root> \
  --ignore-session-pin --fix-mailboxes
```

## Exit Codes

Treat AMQ's process exit code as the stable machine contract:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success. The command completed normally. |
| `1` | General error. The failure has no more specific exit-code classification. |
| `2` | Usage error. Arguments, flags, or command input are invalid. |
| `3` | Not found. A requested resource such as a mailbox, message, session, agent, or configuration does not exist. |
| `4` | Timeout. A watch, monitor, receipt wait, or delivery wait reached its deadline. |
| `5` | Context mismatch. A syntactically valid route was refused, including a pin conflict or an ineligible implicit root inside Git. |
| `6` | Action required. The command cannot proceed without an operator action (untrusted launch plan, unknown backend inspect, stale conversation token, blocked rebind, or emitted `coop exec` commands still to run). |

Do not parse stderr prose as a stable discriminator. `--json` preserves the
same process exit codes. A read-only `list` on a mismatched session pin warns
and continues; commands that consume or mutate mailbox state fail with code
`5`.

When a command reports per-agent outcomes, whole-command failures that precede
any per-agent work keep codes `2`, `5`, and `3` and preempt mixed results. Once
per-agent work begins, the process exit code is the highest-precedence per-agent
outcome: `6` over `4` over `1` over `0`. Expected dispositions (`disabled`,
`unsupported`, and policy-consistent `fresh`) contribute `0`. Launch Apply and
lifecycle JSON also carry a typed mutation disposition (`not_applied`,
`committed`, or `uncertain`) for the backend binding; that field is not a
process exit code.

## Delivery Receipts

AMQ records delivery outcomes in consumer-local receipt files. The main stages are:

- `drained` — a consumer successfully ingested the message
- `dlq` — the message was moved to the dead letter queue during ingest

Use these when you need confirmation rather than just fire-and-forget messaging:

```bash
# Block on delivery for a single-recipient send
amq send --to codex --body "please review" --wait-for drained --wait-timeout 60s

# Query receipt history later
amq receipts list --me codex --msg-id <msg_id>
amq receipts wait --me codex --msg-id <msg_id> --stage drained --timeout 60s
```

`amq read`, `amq drain`, and `amq monitor` all apply the same strict header validation. Messages in `inbox/new` that are corrupt or have malformed headers are moved to DLQ and produce a `dlq` receipt.

DLQ retries use four durable states: `ready`, `pending`, `delivered`, and
`indeterminate`. A successful retry retains a terminal audit in `dlq/cur` until
purge. `delivered` is idempotent and reports `already_delivered` plus
`audit_finalized`; `--force` cannot redeliver it. A `pending` or legacy
`indeterminate` envelope without a visible inbox destination refuses retry,
including with `--force`; that flag bypasses only the maximum retry count.
Bulk JSON separates `retried`, `already_delivered`, and `skipped`, and its
`count` includes only newly retried messages.

`amq who` and `amq doctor --ops` report `notifier_live` only when the wake-lock
inspector verifies a live `amq wake` process identity. That proves prompt
notification, not message consumption. `recent_activity` means only that
`last_seen` is fresh. Use `drain` or `monitor` when consumption is required;
run long-lived wake/monitor commands under launchd, systemd, or another
supervisor rather than treating AMQ itself as a daemon.

Before replacing a wake, run `amq wake check --me <agent> --json`. It is
read-only and reports the running/current image path and version plus an exact
`next_action`. An automated agent may act only when
`restart_capability=agent_safe`. For `operator_only`, leave the live wake
running and hand off to its owning terminal or supervisor. For `unavailable`,
preserve the state and diagnose it. Never kill a live raw wake from a non-TTY
process, and never accept an attention-only fallback as a replacement for
full-strength input delivery. When the recorded image or restart stage lives
under a directory that no longer exists, the check reports
`reason_code=binary_dir_gone` and names `amq doctor --ops --fix-wake-locks`
instead of a raw ENOENT.

Current resume-eligible `coop exec` wakes automatically observe their stable
AMQ launch symlink and adopt a strictly newer semantic version at a fully
quiescent boundary, preserving PID, terminal ownership, and unread messages.
Use `wake check --json --json-schema=2` to inspect `self_upgrade`; a refused
candidate is attempted at most once until manual restart, lock replacement, or
a new candidate. `--no-self-upgrade` and `AMQ_WAKE_NO_SELF_UPGRADE=1` disable
this only for the launched wake. Ownerless, keepalive, repair, destructive
interrupt, arbitrary-inject, and pinned-path wakes remain manual.

Those consuming commands, `watch`, and all DLQ commands refuse a raw
target that conflicts with a complete `AM_BASE_ROOT`/`AM_SESSION` pin before
touching mailbox state. `send` and `reply` apply the same check to their source
context. Use `--session <name>` for deliberate sibling access. The raw-root
escape hatch, `--ignore-session-pin`, requires a non-empty explicit `--root`;
it never blesses an inherited `AM_ROOT`. `list` warns and remains available for
non-destructive inspection. With no session/tree evidence, scripts and CI
remain fail-open. A missing mailbox is an error, not an empty inbox. Empty
`drain` and `list --new` results may print a stderr note when the same handle
has pending messages in a sibling session; follow the exact `amq list --session
<name> --me <handle> --new` command in that note.
This is an operational safety check, not an authorization boundary; a local
process can deliberately repin or override it.

For `doctor`, `--root` selects the exact target but does not waive the active
pin. Read-only inspection continues and reports a mismatch warning.
`--fix-mailboxes` and `--ops --fix-wake-locks` require a matching pin unless an explicit non-empty
`--root` is paired with `--ignore-session-pin`. `--base-root` requires
`--root`, supplies retained config authority for the target or one direct
child, and never waives the pin.

## Session Layout

By default, the root is `.agent-mail` (from `.amqrc` or auto-detect). Use `--session` to create isolated subdirectories:

```
.agent-mail/              ← default root (configurable in `.amqrc`)
.agent-mail/auth/         ← isolated session (via --session auth)
.agent-mail/api/          ← isolated session (via --session api)
```

- `amq coop exec claude` → `AM_ROOT=.agent-mail/collab` (default session)
- `amq coop exec --session auth claude` → `AM_ROOT=.agent-mail/auth`

The main env vars are `AM_ROOT` (where) + `AM_ME` (who). `coop exec` also sets
`AM_BASE_ROOT` for cross-session resolution and `AM_SESSION` as the independent
session identity used by consuming-command guards. The CLI enforces correct
routing — run bare commands for the current session or use `--session` for a
named sibling.
Default `.agent-mail/<session>` layouts are recognized even without `.amqrc`; custom root names still need config or explicit flags/env.

## Cross-Project Routing

Send messages to agents in other projects via `--project` or inline `@project:session` syntax. Requires peer configuration in `.amqrc`.

**When to use `--session` vs `--project`**: `--session` = same project, different session. `--project` = different project. Change one dimension at a time.

### Peer setup

Add `project` and `peers` to your `.amqrc`:
```json
{
  "root": ".agent-mail",
  "project": "my-project",
  "peers": {
    "infra-lib": "/Users/me/projects/infra-lib/.agent-mail"
  }
}
```

Both projects must register each other as peers for round-trip messaging.

**Use `--project`/`--session` to route, not a raw `--root`.** A direct `--root` selects which tree to operate on; it carries no sender-origin metadata, so the recipient can't reply (a naive reply loops back into their own tree). `amq send` therefore **refuses** an explicit `--root` that crosses into a different base tree than your active session (`AM_ROOT`/`AM_BASE_ROOT`) when no `--project`/`--session`/`--from-session` is given. To message another project replyably, register the peer and use `--project` (or inline `@project`). If a send is genuinely local, set the target as your `AM_ROOT` instead of passing `--root`.

### Sending cross-project

```bash
# Flag syntax
amq send --to codex --project infra-lib --body "hello from here"

# Inline syntax (terser)
amq send --to codex@infra-lib:collab --body "inline syntax"

# Same session name as source (default when --session omitted)
amq send --to codex --project infra-lib --body "delivers to same session"
```

### Replies route automatically

When you receive a cross-project message, `reply_project` is set in the header. `amq reply` routes back automatically — no `--project` flag needed:
```bash
amq reply --id <msg_id> --body "got it"  # routes back via reply_project
```

### Thread naming

- **Same project P2P**: `p2p/claude__codex`
- **Cross-project P2P**: `p2p/projA:collab:claude__projB:collab:codex`
- **Topical** (cross-project): use same thread ID across projects, e.g., `decision/release-v0.24`

For full details, see [references/cross-project.md](references/cross-project.md).

### Cross-project identity (IMPORTANT)

When you receive a message where `from` matches your own handle (e.g., `from: "claude"` and you are claude), check `from_project` and `reply_project`. If either is present and names a different project, this is **NOT an echo** — it is a legitimate cross-project message from a different agent instance with the same handle. Process it normally.

### AM_ROOT scoping after cross-project sends

After sending a cross-project message (via `--project`), your `AM_ROOT` still points to YOUR project. To send to your own partner (same project), use plain `amq send --to codex` — do NOT use `--project`. The `--project` flag is ONLY for sending to agents in OTHER projects.

## Two-host fleets

A different machine is a different AMQ host, not a `--project` and not a
foreign `--root`. Each host has its own handles; `claude` on G is not `claude`
on the Mac. Cross-host mail is companion `amq-bridge` only.

- Address receiver-owned aliases `<host>/<agent>`.
- The destination host applies the signed envelope into its own Maildir.
- The proven hop is `amq-bridge apply-file` (operator-moved drop file, no
  public locker). Replies keep the inbound opaque thread id.
- Bot chat must invoke `scripts/amq-bridge-bot-enqueue.sh` with argv exactly
  `--dest-alias host/agent`; it reads `AMQ_BRIDGE_ENQUEUE_CONFIG`. Prompt text
  must not pass `--root`, `--rendezvous`, `--me`, or `--spool`.
- HTTPS courier remains for an operator-provided rendezvous. AMQ does not
  ship a hosted relay. Do not treat a missing rendezvous as a reason to
  remote-drain or copy Maildirs.

See [amq-bridge](https://github.com/avivsinai/agent-message-queue/blob/main/cmd/amq-bridge/README.md).

## Decision Threads

Decentralized decision protocol using existing AMQ primitives (no new CLI commands).

- **Thread**: `decision/<topic>`
- **Kind**: `decision` for all messages
- **Labels**: `decision:proposal`, `decision:objection`, `decision:support`, `decision:final`; plus `project:<name>` for cross-project decisions
- **Context** on proposals: `{"proposal_id": "...", "question": "...", "options": [...], "required_projects": [...], "deadline": "..."}`

**Process**: Propose → Review/Object → Resolve objections → Close when all required projects responded and no unresolved blocking objections.

```bash
amq send --to codex --project infra-lib --kind decision \
  --labels "decision:proposal,project:my-project,project:infra-lib" \
  --thread "decision/api-v2" \
  --context '{"proposal_id":"api-v2","question":"Adopt new API?","required_projects":["my-project","infra-lib"]}' \
  --body "Proposal: migrate to API v2. All tests green."
```

## Session-Aware Routing

Users refer to sessions using many words: "session", "stream", "squad", "team", "workspace", "channel", or just a bare name. When the user mentions sending to or talking to an agent in a named context (e.g., "ask codex on stream1", "send to the auth team", "talk to codex in squad-api"), you must discover sessions before routing.

**Important**: Do not confuse sessions with projects. "Project" in AMQ means a different repo/codebase (cross-project routing via `--project`). Sessions are isolated mailbox trees within the same project (via `--session`). If the user says "the infra project", that likely means `--project infra`, not `--session infra`.

```bash
# Step 1: Discover active sessions and agents
amq who --json
# Returns: [{"name":"collab","agents":[...]},{"name":"stream1","agents":[...]},{"name":"auth","agents":[...]}]

# Step 2: Match the user's name against session names in the output, then send
amq send --to codex --session stream1 --body "Message for stream1"
```

**Recognition patterns** — any of these mean "route to a specific session":
- Explicit: "on stream1", "via auth", "in the api session", "the infra squad"
- Bare name: user just says "stream1" or "auth" — could be a session or an agent handle
- Colloquial: "team", "squad", "stream", "workspace", "channel" followed by a name

Note: The `agent@name` inline syntax (e.g., `codex@infra`) is for cross-project routing, not cross-session. For same-project session routing, always use `--session <name>` explicitly.

**Rules**:
1. When the user names something that could be a session, **always run `amq who --json` first** to check if it matches a known session name
2. If the name matches a session, use `--session <name>` on the send command
3. If it matches both a session and an agent handle, prefer the session interpretation when the user's phrasing implies a group/context ("on X", "in X", "the X team"), and the agent interpretation when it implies a person ("ask X", "tell X")
4. If the target session differs from your current session (`$AM_ROOT` basename), use `--session <name>`
5. Never guess — if the name doesn't appear in `amq who --json` output, tell the user (it may need `amq session create <name>`)
6. For cross-project routing (different repo), use `--project` instead — see Cross-Project Routing section

## Messaging

```bash
amq send --to codex --body "Message"              # Send (uses AM_ROOT/AM_ME from env)
amq drain --include-body                          # Receive (one-shot, silent when empty)
amq drain --session auth --include-body           # Deliberate sibling-session receive
amq reply --id <msg_id> --body "Response"          # Reply in thread
amq watch --timeout 60s                           # Block until message arrives
amq list --new                                    # Peek without side effects
amq send --to grok --body "hello"                 # Grok is a normal peer handle, like codex or claude
```

### Send with metadata
```bash
amq send --to codex --subject "Review" --kind review_request --body @file.md
amq send --to codex --priority urgent --kind question --body "Blocked on API"
amq send --to codex --labels "bug,parser" --context '{"paths": ["src/"]}' --body "Found issue"
echo "evidence: tests green" | amq send --to codex --subject "done" --body -   # - reads stdin
```

**Body is fail-closed.** `--body -` (or `--body @-`, or omitting `--body`) reads stdin; a literal string or `@file` is used as-is. A send whose resolved body is empty/whitespace is **rejected** with a usage error instead of delivering a blank message — so `--body -` with nothing piped fails loudly rather than shipping an empty body. Pass `--allow-empty` only when you truly want a blank body (subject carries everything).

**Unrouted self-addressing is fail-closed.** When `--to` resolves to your own handle and no `--project`, `--session`, or `--from-session` routing dimension is present, `amq send` refuses the ambiguous same-root send. Use routing to reach another instance of the same handle. Pass `--allow-self` only to confirm an intentional same-root self-send; it does not bypass cross-tree or session-pin guards.

**Send file paths, not file contents.** When attaching source code, configs, or large text for review, send the file path in the message body, not the contents inline. The receiver can open the file with their local tools. If the receiver cannot access that worktree, send a short diff instead of the full source.

### Filter
```bash
amq list --new --priority urgent
amq list --new --from codex --kind review_request
amq list --new --label bug
```

## Operator Gates

Almost all coordination is agent-to-agent. Occasionally the **next required actor is a human**: an approval, a manual test, a deploy only a person can run, or sign-off that a goal is complete. AMQ has no separate "gate" feature. You represent this **structurally**: address a message to the human's mailbox instead of describing the wait in prose to another agent.

The single invariant AMQ relies on here is **recipient-as-next-actor**: a message addressed to the human handle means a human is who must act next. Everything else below (the `gate/<topic>` thread name and the `APPROVAL:` / `DONE:` subject prefixes) is a **naming convention** that downstream tools like amq-noc watch for. AMQ routing and message classification do **not** special-case thread names or subject text; those are plain strings, useful only because humans and tooling agree to read them. They are conventions, not core AMQ semantics.

### The human handle is `user`

By convention the human/operator mailbox is `user`. AMQ reserves this handle for validation in configured projects, so `--to user` is accepted wherever the project has a configured agent list. New co-op projects include `user` in the default agent set. For explicit `amq init --agents ...` projects or older roots, initialize the mailbox layout before relying on human drain/receipt/DLQ ergonomics:

```bash
# Seed the human mailbox alongside the agents (one-time, per project)
amq init --root .agent-mail --agents claude,codex,user
# or, for a coop project:
amq coop init --agents claude,codex,user
```

Throughout this section, `user` means "the conventional human handle." In configured projects it is warning-free for strict handle validation; in older or explicitly seeded roots, make sure the `agents/user/` mailbox exists before expecting a human to drain and reply from it.

### Raising a gate

Use a stable `gate/<topic>` thread so a gate and its resolution stay together:

```bash
# Approval / choice / manual test a human must perform
amq send --to user --thread gate/<topic> --kind question \
  --subject "APPROVAL: <decision>" \
  --body "<what you need a human to approve or run, and why>"

# Human closeout of a completed goal (sign-off that the goal is done)
amq send --to user --thread gate/<topic> --kind decision \
  --subject "DONE: <goal>" \
  --body "<what was completed; what the human should confirm or close>"
```

The human answers on the **same** thread from their own terminal or client, e.g. `amq send --me user --to <agent> --thread gate/<topic> --kind answer --subject "APPROVED: <decision>" --body "<approval / answer text>"` (use `DENIED:` or `ANSWER:` for a rejection or a plain answer). Reusing the `gate/<topic>` thread is what lets a watcher pair the answer with the open gate and clear it.

### When NOT to raise a gate

Keep ordinary coordination agent-to-agent. Do **not** send to `user` for:

- FYIs and status updates -> `status` on a normal thread
- Acknowledgements
- Routine code review between agents -> `review_request` / `review_response`
- Agent-owned blockers (waiting on another agent, a build, or a flaky test)

If the escalation owner is a lead/CTO agent, **they** decide whether to escalate, and that decision is agent-to-agent. But once a human action is actually required, it still becomes a `to:user` gate so tooling can observe it.

### Anti-pattern

Prose like `operator-held`, `pending operator`, or `manual approval` **inside an agent-to-agent message is not a gate**. It is body text a human or tool has to guess at. If a human must act, address the human.

### What a gate is, and is not

- **It is an observability / handoff signal, not authorization or security.** AMQ sender identity is local convention, not authenticated approval. A `to:user` gate records that a human is the next actor; it does **not** grant permission or prove a human approved anything. Do not treat it as an access-control boundary.
- **Cross-session / cross-project gates must be intentional.** Default examples target the human mailbox in the **current** session/project. Routing a gate to another session's or project's `user` is a deliberate act (`--session` / `--project`), never the default. Gate-clearing is a consumer/orchestrator convention unless AMQ later adds explicit gate state.

## Priority Handling

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `urgent` | Interrupt current work, respond now |
| `normal` | Add to TODOs, respond after current task |
| `low` | Batch for session end |

## Message Kinds

| Kind | Reply Kind | Default Priority |
|------|------------|------------------|
| `review_request` | `review_response` | normal |
| `question` | `answer` | normal |
| `decision` | — | normal |
| `todo` | — | normal |
| `status` | — | low |
| `brainstorm` | — | normal |
