**A local, file-based interoperability bus for agent sessions and adapters.**

AMQ manages the conversation: agent-to-agent messaging, thread continuity, cross-session and cross-project routing, handoff state, and operational visibility. It does not try to own task decomposition, worktree management, dependency scheduling, or scheduler execution; Claude Code teams, Codex, Kanban, Symphony, and similar orchestrators stay one layer above it.

**Start here:** [Getting started](#getting-started) — install, start two agents, send one message.

## Why AMQ?

Modern AI-assisted development often involves multiple agents working on the same codebase. But without coordination:
- Agents duplicate work or create conflicts
- Reviews require human intermediation
- Context switching kills productivity

AMQ gives agents a **local interoperability bus**: they can send messages, reply in threads, share status, and optionally consume adapter-emitted events through the same queue primitives. The core product stays intentionally small: file-based messages first, lightweight adapters second.

### Key Features

- **Zero infrastructure** — Pure file-based. No server, no daemon, no database. Works anywhere files work.
- **Crash-safe** — Atomic Maildir delivery (tmp→new→cur). Messages are never partially written or lost.
- **Human-readable** — JSON frontmatter + Markdown body. Inspect with `cat`, debug with `grep`, version with `git`.
- **Real-time notifications** — `amq wake` injects terminal notifications when messages arrive.
- **Built for agents** — Priority levels, message kinds, threading, delivery receipts, and waitable handoffs.
- **Cross-project federation** — Route messages across peer repos, preserve reply routing, and run decision threads that span projects.
- **Swarm mode** — Join Claude Code Agent Teams, claim tasks, and bridge task notifications into AMQ.
- **Optional adapters** — Lightweight Symphony hooks and an experimental Kanban bridge can emit normal AMQ messages with structured metadata.
- **Operational diagnostics** — `amq doctor --ops` shows queue depth, sibling-session backlogs, DLQ state, presence freshness, and integration hints.
- **Two-host fleets** — Companion `amq-bridge` hops signed envelopes between two local AMQ roots (`apply-file` today; HTTPS courier when an operator provisions a rendezvous).

### v1 will not

AMQ Core stays a local CLI. These stay out of the `amq` binary and out of v1
product claims (see [two-host fleets](docs/adr-two-host-fleets.md) and
[bridge protocol](docs/adr-bridge-protocol.md)):

- sockets or listeners in `amq`
- Maildir sync or remote drain of a foreign mailbox
- git as the cross-host relay
- OAuth MCP inside `amq`, ACP v2, or `--always-approve` in committed launch plans
- prompt-selected `--root` / argv / env / executable
- AMQ holding a Buzz nsec; Mac mailbox files on the Grok Bot VM
- silent inject→notify or submit→prefill; Accessibility scraping of ChatGPT

Cross-host mail is companion `amq-bridge` (alias send / local apply / same-thread reply), not Core. The proven hop is `amq-bridge apply-file` on the destination host. The HTTPS courier stays implemented for an operator-provided rendezvous; AMQ does not ship a hosted relay. See [amq-bridge](cmd/amq-bridge/README.md).

<a id="quick-start"></a>

## Getting started

About five minutes from install to the first delivered message. You need two
agent CLIs on `PATH`. This walkthrough uses **Claude Code** (`claude`) and
**Codex CLI** (`codex`) on one machine. `amq setup` also detects Grok Build
(`grok`) and Cursor when `agent` is on `PATH` (or legacy `cursor-agent` if
`agent` is absent).

Native Windows can run the core queue from the Windows ZIP, but this
walkthrough needs `coop exec` and `wake`, which are not supported natively.
Use WSL with the Linux binary. See the
[platform capability matrix](INSTALL.md#platform-capability-matrix).

### 1. Install the binary

**macOS (Homebrew):**

```bash
brew install avivsinai/tap/amq
```

**macOS / Linux (script):**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avivsinai/agent-message-queue/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

The script installs to `~/.local/bin` or `~/go/bin` (no sudo). Review it
before running. It fails unless `checksums.txt` has exactly one valid entry
for the selected asset and `sha256sum` or `shasum` verifies it before
extraction.

Verify:

```bash
amq --version
```

Manual download, Windows ZIP, and build-from-source are in
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

### 2. Install Skill

So each agent knows the AMQ commands:

```bash
npx skills add avivsinai/agent-message-queue -g -y
```

If you used the install script instead of Homebrew, you can do binary and
skill in one step:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avivsinai/agent-message-queue/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --skill
```

Other skill methods (skild, marketplace, manual copy) are in
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). Restart the agent after installing.

### 3. Set up the project

In the repository the two agents will share:

```bash
amq setup
```

Setup probes for Claude, Codex, and Grok (and Cursor when present), previews the
roster and launcher preference, then writes `.amqrc`, `.amq/launch.json`,
local preferences, the default session, and roster mailboxes. Confirm the
preview.

If setup reports `no supported agent CLI detected`, install `claude` and
`codex`, put them on `PATH`, and run `amq setup` again.

### 4. Start both agents

```bash
amq launch
```

The first launch asks you to trust the plan. That confirmation is stored
outside the worktree.

- If launch selects `tmux`, `cmux`, or `ghostty`, both agents start in that
  app.
- If launch selects the `commands` backend, it prints one complete
  `coop exec` line per agent and exits `6`. Paste each emitted line into
  its own terminal. Do not rewrite the lines: they bind the session, launch
  nonce, provider arguments, and execution ticket.

Start both agents before sending. A newly started wake baselines messages
that were already waiting, so they stay unread but do not notify. If you
sent first, run `amq drain --include-body` in the target agent.

### 5. Send one message and see it arrive

In the Claude terminal (`AM_ME` is already set):

```bash
amq send --to codex --subject "Hello" --body "Can you see this?"
```

In the Codex terminal:

```bash
amq list --new
amq drain --include-body
```

You should see Claude's message, then the drained body. That is the loop:
`send` on one side, `list` / `drain` on the other. Reply with
`amq reply --id <msg_id> --body "..."` when you have a message ID.

Roles, phases, and troubleshooting live in [COOP.md](COOP.md). Daily
commands after this first message are in [Messaging](#messaging) below.

## Installation

The default install is in [Getting started](#getting-started). More methods
(releases ZIP, checksums, source build, skill marketplace) are in
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

### Updating

Homebrew:

```bash
brew upgrade amq
```

Retire live wakes started by the previous Cellar binary first. If a leftover
lock's image directory is gone, `wake check` reports `binary_dir_gone`;
remove it with `amq doctor --ops --fix-wake-locks`. See
[Wake operations](docs/wake-operations.md).

GitHub Actions `verify-brew-release` confirms a published tag installs from
`avivsinai/tap/amq` and that `amq --version` matches that tag. It does not
replace `brew upgrade` on an operator machine.

Install-script or other manual binary installs:

```bash
amq upgrade
```

### Keepalive companion

`amq-keepalive` is developed and released from this repository alongside AMQ.
`make build` produces both binaries, and each AMQ release includes a separate
`amq-keepalive` archive stamped with the same release version. Verify a build
with any equivalent form:

```bash
amq-keepalive -v
amq-keepalive --version
amq-keepalive version
```

See [COOP.md](COOP.md#supervisor-recipes) for the operational guide.

## Setup and launch

`amq setup` is the one-time project configuration. `amq launch` reconciles
the committed roster and starts or resumes that session.

```bash
amq setup
amq launch
amq session create feature-x   # once, before the first named-session launch
amq launch --session feature-x
amq session resume feature-x
```

`launch` reads the committed roster, selects the declared default session
when `--session` is absent, and resumes exact provider-qualified conversation
IDs. It never uses a provider's "last" or "continue" heuristic. The first
semantic plan, and each semantic plan change, requires an interactive trust
confirmation stored outside the worktree. Non-interactive or `--json` calls
exit `6` until that digest is trusted. An unknown `session resume` name
exits `3` and writes nothing. Managed backends use a fail-closed recovery
journal; see [Managed launch recovery](docs/launch-recovery.md).

Registered launchers are `commands`, `tmux`, `cmux` (envelope `>=0.64.3 <1.0`,
protocol 2), and `ghostty` (AppleScript, envelope `>=1.3.0 <2.0`).
`--launcher auto` is the default: it walks the local launcher preference and
selects the first backend whose Detect reports Available. An explicit
`--launcher <name>` wins. When `CMUX_SURFACE_ID` is set, auto prepends
`cmux` ahead of `ghostty`; otherwise `TERM_PROGRAM=ghostty` prepends
`ghostty`. Setup lists cmux and Ghostty in `available_launchers` only after
their Detect ping succeeds, not from `LookPath` alone.

The `commands` backend prints complete `coop exec` commands and exits `6`
because executing them is the remaining operator action. Paste those emitted
lines exactly, one per terminal. Managed `tmux`, `cmux`, and `ghostty`
backends run the declared plan in-app instead of printing those lines.

Grok Build is also supported by the managed launch adapter. It mints an exact
`--session-id` from the AMQ launch nonce and resumes only with the stored
`--resume <UUID>`; `--continue`, `--always-approve`, and `--yolo` are rejected
from committed launch arguments. Grok uses `--tools` / `--disallowed-tools`
with opaque provider names (not Claude `--allowedTools`).

Each launched agent gets a session environment and wake notifications. See
[COOP.md](COOP.md#running-co-op-mode) for co-op operations.

Provider arguments belong in the committed `.amq/launch.json`, so `launch`
can validate and include them in its semantic trust digest. For example:

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "default_session": "collab",
  "agents": [
    {
      "handle": "claude",
      "adapter": "claude",
      "command": ["claude", "--permission-mode", "acceptEdits"],
      "resume_policy": "resume"
    },
    {
      "handle": "codex",
      "adapter": "codex",
      "command": ["codex", "--sandbox", "workspace-write", "--ask-for-approval", "on-request"],
      "resume_policy": "resume"
    }
  ],
  "layout": {"type": "columns"}
}
```

Dangerous permission-bypass flags are not valid committed arguments. Keep
them in an operator-controlled direct `coop exec` invocation when that
low-level path is intentionally required.

### Named sessions

For isolated pairs (multiple pairs on different features):

```bash
amq session create feature-a
amq launch --session feature-a
```

When launch uses the `commands` backend, paste the complete emitted commands
into separate terminals.

### Non-interactive setup

Automation uses a stateless preview and applies only that approved digest.
The first non-interactive setup must name the roster, default session, and
launcher preference explicitly:

```bash
setup_args=(--agents claude,codex --default-session collab --launcher-preference commands)
setup_preview="$(amq setup --preview --json "${setup_args[@]}")"
setup_digest="$(printf '%s\n' "$setup_preview" | jq -r '.preview.digest')"
amq setup --apply "$setup_digest" "${setup_args[@]}"
```

`--preview` performs zero writes. `--apply` recomputes the preview and exits
`6` without writing if its `sha256:<hex>` digest differs. `-y` remains
available for callers that already own an approval gate, but it cannot be
combined with `--preview` or `--apply`.

### Shell aliases

Optional aliases are a convenience, not part of [Getting started](#getting-started).
A bare `eval "$(amq shell-setup)"` affects only the current shell. To make
aliases such as `amc`, `amx`, and `amg` available in future terminals, add
the setup command to your shell startup file:

```bash
# zsh
amq shell-setup --shell zsh >> ~/.zshrc

# bash
amq shell-setup --shell bash >> ~/.bashrc
```

Run the appropriate append command once, then open a new terminal or source
that startup file. Use the bare `eval` only when you intentionally want
aliases in one already-open shell.

`coop init` and direct `coop exec` provisioning remain available as legacy
low-level plumbing. See [COOP.md](COOP.md#low-level-provisioning) for those
paths, operator-only bypass examples, and advanced wake options; they are
not a second project-onboarding flow.

Scripts and orchestrators that must plan and apply a session without parsing
human output should use the public launch contract in
[docs/launch-api.md](docs/launch-api.md) and
[schemas/launch-api-v1.schema.json](schemas/launch-api-v1.schema.json).

## Messaging

Inside a launched agent, identity and session are already set:

```bash
amq send --to codex --subject "Review needed" --kind review_request \
  --body "Please review internal/cli/send.go"

amq list --new
amq list --new --priority urgent
amq list --new --from codex --kind review_request

amq drain --include-body

amq send --to codex --body "Please pick this up" \
  --wait-for drained --wait-timeout 60s

amq receipts list --me codex --msg-id <msg_id>

amq reply --id <msg_id> --kind review_response --body "LGTM with comments"
```

To send between known sessions before entering `coop exec`:

```bash
amq send --root .agent-mail --from-session feature-a --me claude \
  --to codex --session feature-b --body "Please review the setup"
```

`read`, `drain`, and `monitor` apply the same strict message validation.
Invalid messages move to DLQ and produce a `dlq` receipt. Participating
shells also pin their exact session context and refuse mismatched mailbox
operations. See [Session routing and safety](docs/session-routing.md).

## Health

```bash
amq doctor
amq doctor --ops
amq wake check --me <agent>
```

`amq wake check` is read-only. It reports whether this process can start or
repair a wake, and a `restart_capability` of `agent_safe`, `operator_only`,
or `unavailable` with an exact next action. Automated agents may act only on
`agent_safe`; leave a live wake running otherwise.

Wake lock states, JSON schema 2, repair, owner recovery, retirement, and
quarantine rules are in [Wake operations](docs/wake-operations.md),
[wake lifecycle](docs/wake-lifecycle.md), and
[wake state invariants](docs/wake-state-invariants.md). Consumption itself
is `drain` / `monitor`, evidenced by receipts. Long-running `wake` /
`monitor` under systemd or launchd is in
[Supervisor recipes](COOP.md#supervisor-recipes).

## Message Kinds & Priority

AMQ messages support kinds (`review_request`, `question`, `todo`, etc.) and priority levels (`urgent`, `normal`, `low`). See [COOP.md](COOP.md) for the full protocol.

## Co-op Mode

For real-time Claude Code + Codex CLI collaboration patterns, roles, and phased workflows, see [COOP.md](COOP.md).

## Cross-Project Federation

AMQ can route messages across repositories, not just across agents in one checkout. Add a project name plus peer roots to `.amqrc`:

```json
{
  "root": ".agent-mail",
  "project": "app",
  "peers": {
    "infra-lib": "/Users/me/src/infra-lib/.agent-mail"
  }
}
```

Then send directly to another project:

```bash
amq send --to codex --project infra-lib --body "Can you review the shared API change?"
amq send --to codex@infra-lib:collab --thread decision/release-v0.24 --kind decision \
  --labels "decision:proposal,project:app,project:infra-lib" \
  --body "Proposal: align both repos on v0.24"
```

Replies route back automatically with the stamped `reply_project` metadata. When `from` matches your own handle, inspect `from_project` before treating the message as an echo; the same handle in a different project is a legitimate cross-project sender. This shipped in v0.22.0 and is the recommended way to coordinate multi-repo agent work without adding a broker.

## Swarm Mode (Claude Code Agent Teams)

External agents (Codex, etc.) can join Claude Code Agent Teams via `amq swarm join`, claim tasks, and receive notifications through `amq swarm bridge`. Note: the bridge delivers task notifications only; direct messages require relay through the team leader.

For the full command reference, see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Global Root Fallback

Most AMQ commands resolve the queue root from the project `.amqrc` or the
default `.agent-mail` layout in the current tree. For agents launched outside
an AMQ-enabled repo by external orchestrators, you can configure a global
root. Explicit `AMQ_GLOBAL_ROOT` does not shadow project `.amqrc`, but it does
take precedence over repo-local auto-detection:

```bash
export AMQ_GLOBAL_ROOT="$HOME/.agent-mail"
```

Or create `~/.amqrc`:

```json
{"root": ".agent-mail"}
```

Root resolution precedence is:

```text
explicit --root > AM_ROOT > project-local .amqrc > AMQ_GLOBAL_ROOT > implicit fallbacks
```

Inside a Git worktree or bare repository, the remaining eligible fallback is
repo-local detected `.agent-mail`; implicit `~/.amqrc` is refused. Outside
Git, `~/.amqrc` remains a convenience fallback and precedes detected
`.agent-mail`. Set
`AMQ_GLOBAL_ROOT` explicitly when shared routing is intentional.

`coop exec` honors that precedence before bootstrap. In a Git worktree with no
eligible root, it bootstraps `<git-top>/.agent-mail`; `--session X` creates that
named session afterward, while `--no-init` preserves the refusal. `coop init`
is the explicit local-bootstrap command and also targets the Git top. Bare
repositories do not auto-bootstrap.

If a project `.amqrc` exists but cannot be read or parsed, AMQ stops instead
of silently delivering through a lower-precedence fallback. Use an explicit
`--root` or `AM_ROOT` when you intentionally need to override that config.

For an external orchestrator or plain shell that should stay pinned to one
session, opt in explicitly:

```sh
amq_context="$(amq env --session auth --me claude --export)" && eval "$amq_context"
```

Every shell-mode `amq env` output replaces the complete context: `AM_ROOT`,
`AM_ROOT_ID`, `AM_ME`, `AM_BASE_ROOT`, `AM_BASE_ROOT_ID`, and `AM_SESSION`.
The two `_ID` values are opaque physical-identity tokens emitted or unset by
AMQ; do not set them manually. Sessionless output sets `AM_BASE_ROOT` to the
exact root and writes an empty `AM_SESSION`, so changing to another sessionless
root is detectable. `--export` additionally prints a stderr note that the
terminal is pinned. Treat this as one terminal, one session.

Auto-detect covers the default `.agent-mail` layout, including `.agent-mail/<session>` session roots without `.amqrc`. Custom root names and peer config still require `.amqrc` or explicit flags/env.
This same chain is used by `amq env`, `amq doctor`, and the integration commands, so Symphony and Kanban-launched agents can find the correct queue even when they are not started from the project directory.

## Extension Metadata

Higher-level layers can store launch records, role metadata, restore state, and indexes without writing into AMQ-owned mailbox directories. AMQ reserves these extension namespaces:

```text
<AM_ROOT>/extensions/<layer>/
<AM_ROOT>/agents/<handle>/extensions/<layer>/
```

Layer names use lowercase ASCII letters, digits, hyphen, underscore, and dot; reverse-DNS names are supported. For example, [amq-squad](https://github.com/omriariav/amq-squad) — a role-aware agent team launcher built on AMQ — stores its launch records and role state under `io.github.omriariav.amq-squad`. AMQ does not create files inside layer-owned directories, and `amq cleanup` leaves extension directories alone unless a future command explicitly targets extension metadata.

Layers may publish a passive manifest at:

```text
<AM_ROOT>/extensions/<layer>/manifest.json
```

`amq doctor --json` reports valid manifests under `extension_manifests` and malformed metadata under `extension_diagnostics`. Manifests are diagnostics-only: AMQ does not execute extension code, load callbacks, or invoke hooks from them. See [docs/adr-layer-extensions.md](docs/adr-layer-extensions.md) for the full contract.

## Integrations

AMQ transports **messages**, not remote task state. The integration layer is intentionally narrow: optional adapters convert external lifecycle or task events into normal AMQ messages. Integration messages are self-delivered (`from=<me>`, `to=<me>`) so an agent monitoring its own inbox can react without polling another tool directly.

### Symphony

Symphony support is a lightweight hook recipe for Codex workspaces orchestrated through `WORKFLOW.md`:

```bash
amq integration symphony init --me codex
amq integration symphony init --me codex --check
amq integration symphony emit --event after_run --me codex
```

`init` patches an AMQ-managed fragment into `WORKFLOW.md`. `emit` is hook-friendly and supports `after_create`, `before_run`, `after_run`, and `before_remove`. This stays intentionally small: AMQ does not try to become a Symphony control plane. Current limitation: because `WORKFLOW.md` is parsed and rewritten as structured YAML/Markdown, comments and formatting inside the frontmatter may be normalized.

### Cline Kanban Bridge

The Kanban bridge is **experimental**. Use it when you want runtime session transitions and review handoffs mirrored into AMQ, with the understanding that it depends on a fast-moving preview WebSocket surface:

```bash
amq integration kanban bridge --me codex
amq integration kanban bridge --me codex --workspace-id my-workspace
```

The bridge connects to `ws://127.0.0.1:3484/api/runtime/ws` by default, bootstraps from `snapshot`, refreshes from `workspace_state_updated`, and emits notifications only for task session transitions plus `task_ready_for_review`.

### Integration Metadata

The built-in adapters share a versioned contract under `context.orchestrator`. See [docs/adapter-contract.md](docs/adapter-contract.md) for the formal v1 envelope and stability expectations.

Integration messages also carry standard labels such as:

- `orchestrator`
- `orchestrator:symphony` or `orchestrator:kanban`
- `task-state:<state>`
- `handoff` for review-ready transitions
- `blocking` for failed or interrupted work

That makes integration traffic filterable with existing AMQ primitives such as `amq list --label orchestrator --label handoff`.

## Command Reference

Common command groups:

| Area | Commands |
|------|----------|
| Core messaging | `init`, `send`, `list`, `read`, `drain`, `reply`, `thread`, `trace`, `watch`, `monitor`, `receipts` |
| Collaboration | `setup`, `launch`, `coop init`, `coop exec`, `session create`, `session list`, `session resume`, `swarm list`, `swarm join`, `swarm tasks`, `swarm bridge` |
| Integrations | `integration symphony init`, `integration symphony emit`, `integration kanban bridge` |
| Operations | `presence set`, `presence list`, `route explain`, `who`, `doctor`, `doctor --ops`, `wake check`, `wake repair`, `wake recover-owner`, `wake retire`, `cleanup`, `dlq *`, `upgrade`, `env`, `shell-setup` |

`--json-schema` requires `--json`. Diagnostic schema 2 and the public launch
`--plan` / `--prepare` / `--apply` forms are in
[docs/wake-lifecycle.md](docs/wake-lifecycle.md) and
[docs/launch-api.md](docs/launch-api.md). Use `amq <command> --help` for
exact flags.

### Exit codes

AMQ exposes stable process exit codes for scripts and agent consumers:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success. The command completed normally. |
| `1` | General error. The failure has no more specific exit-code classification. |
| `2` | Usage error. Arguments, flags, or command input are invalid. |
| `3` | Not found. A requested resource such as a mailbox, message, session, agent, or configuration does not exist. |
| `4` | Timeout. A watch, monitor, receipt wait, or delivery wait reached its deadline. |
| `5` | Context mismatch. A syntactically valid route was refused, including a pin conflict or an ineligible implicit root inside Git. |
| `6` | Action required. The command cannot proceed without an operator action (stale conversation token, unknown backend inspect, untrusted config, blocked rebind). |

The numeric meaning is the machine contract; stderr is human-readable context
and should not be parsed as a stable discriminator. `--json` does not change
these process exit codes. A read-only `list` on a mismatched session pin warns
and continues; commands that consume or mutate mailbox state fail with code
`5`.

When a command reports per-agent outcomes, whole-command failures that precede
any per-agent work keep codes `2`, `5`, and `3` and preempt mixed results. Once
per-agent work begins, the process exit code is the highest-precedence per-agent
outcome: `6` over `4` over `1` over `0`. Expected dispositions (`disabled`,
`unsupported`, and policy-consistent `fresh`) contribute `0`.

For the full CLI syntax, examples, and message schema, see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).
For the read-only trace contract and its evidence limits, see [docs/trace.md](docs/trace.md).

## How It Works

AMQ uses the battle-tested [Maildir](https://cr.yp.to/proto/maildir.html) format:

1. **Write** — Message written to a unique attempt file in `tmp/`
2. **Sync** — File fsynced to disk
3. **Deliver** — No-replace publication to `new/` (never overwrites a retained
   same-name message; identical bytes are idempotent)
4. **Process** — Reader moves to `cur/` after reading

If a different same-name message is already in `new/`, AMQ preserves both
copies and reports a collision. A claim never replaces a retained same-name
message in `cur/`.

This guarantees crash-safety: if the process dies mid-write, no corrupt message appears in the inbox. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full directory layout.

## Built on AMQ

AMQ is meant to be the messaging layer underneath higher-level orchestrators. Projects building on it:

- **[amq-squad](https://github.com/omriariav/amq-squad)** by [@omriariav](https://github.com/omriariav) — a role-aware agent team launcher. AMQ owns messaging between agents; amq-squad owns the layer above: who is on the team, what role each agent plays, the shared norms they follow, and how to bring the whole squad up, down, back, or into a new workstream. It builds on AMQ's [extension metadata](#extension-metadata) surface for launch records and role state.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avivsinai/agent-message-queue.git
cd agent-message-queue
make build   # Build amq plus companion binaries
make test    # Run tests
make ci      # Full CI: vet + lint + test + smoke
```

## FAQ

**Why not just use a database?**
Files are universal, debuggable, and work everywhere. No connection strings, no migrations, no ORM. Just files.

**Why not Redis/RabbitMQ/etc?**
Those require infrastructure. AMQ is for local inter-process communication where agents share a filesystem. No server to configure or keep running.

**What about Windows?**
Native Windows supports the core queue, but not `coop exec` or `wake`. Use WSL
with the Linux binary for the complete co-op workflow. See the explicit
[platform capability matrix](INSTALL.md#platform-capability-matrix).

**Is this production-ready?**
For local development workflows, yes. AMQ is intentionally simple—it's not trying to be a distributed message broker.

**How does AMQ compare to other multi-agent tools?**
Tools like [MCP Agent Mail](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail) (server-based coordination + SQLite), [Gas Town](https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown) (tmux-based orchestration), and others offer richer features. AMQ is intentionally minimal: single Core binary, no server, Maildir delivery. Best for a handful of local agents. Two machines use companion `amq-bridge`, not a shared filesystem.
