# Parallel-Aware AUQ Templates

> Three reusable AskUserQuestion blocks for the parallel-aware preamble (`parallel-aware-preamble.md`).
> Consumed by: autopilot, session-start, session-plan, wave-executor, session-end (5 orchestrator entry-points).

## When to fire which AUQ

Driven by the preamble's outcome (see `parallel-aware-preamble.md` § Outcome Handling):

| Preamble outcome | AUQ to fire |
|------------------|-------------|
| `EXCLUSIVE_BLOCKED` | Exclusive-Conflict AUQ (below) |
| `PROMOTION_OFFER` | Worktree-Promotion AUQ (below) |
| `PASS_THROUGH` | No AUQ |

The third variant — **Always-OK Pass-Through** — fires no AUQ; documented here only for completeness so callers don't reinvent it.

## Exclusive-Conflict AUQ (PRD §3 P1 row 2)

Fires when an `exclusive`-class session (`bootstrap`, `housekeeping`, `memory-cleanup`) is already active in the worktree-family AND the caller is NOT `always-ok`-class.

### Claude Code (AskUserQuestion)

```js
// Unpacked once so the question reads as one sentence instead of five key=value pairs.
const { mode, host, pid, worktreePath } = blockingSession;

AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: `A ${mode} session (process ${pid} on ${host}) started ${ageHours}h ago in ${worktreePath}. What now?`,
    header: "Repo belegt",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Warten (Recommended)", description: "Nothing else can start here until that session closes. This command does not retry — run it again afterwards." },
      { label: "Andere Session beenden", description: "You close it yourself, then run this command again. Nothing here stops the other session for you." },
      { label: "Abbrechen", description: "Exit now. Nothing is written: no STATE.md, no lock." },
    ],
  }],
});
```

### Codex CLI / Cursor IDE / Pi fallback (numbered Markdown list)

```
A <mode> session (process <pid> on <host>) started <ageHours>h ago in <worktreePath>. What now?

1. Warten (Recommended) — nothing else can start here until that session closes; this command does not retry, so run it again afterwards.
2. Andere Session beenden — you close it yourself, then run this command again. Nothing here stops the other session for you.
3. Abbrechen — exit now. Nothing is written: no STATE.md, no lock.

Reply with the number of your choice.
```

The four slots are `blockingSession.mode`, `blockingSession.host`, `blockingSession.pid` and `blockingSession.worktreePath`; `<ageHours>` is the age of that session in hours.

### Outcome handling

- **Warten** → exit Phase-0 cleanly with stderr note `parallel-aware: waiting on exclusive session_id=<id>`. No retry loop.
- **Andere Session beenden** → exit Phase-0 cleanly with stderr note `parallel-aware: deferred to operator — exclusive session_id=<id>`. No automatic termination.
- **Abbrechen** → exit Phase-0 immediately. No file writes.

## Worktree-Promotion AUQ (PRD §3 P1 row 3)

Fires when the caller is `parallel-ok`-class AND another `parallel-ok` session is active in the SAME worktree (i.e., main worktree collision).

### Claude Code (AskUserQuestion)

```js
// Unpacked once so the question reads as one sentence instead of three key=value pairs.
const { mode, pid } = parallelPeer;

AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: `A ${mode} session (process ${pid}) started ${ageHours}h ago in this same folder. Run separately or alongside?`,
    header: "Wo starten?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Worktree anlegen + starten (Recommended)", description: "Creates a second working folder beside this one and starts there — isolates your edits, so nothing collides." },
      { label: "Manuell — in-place daneben", description: "Both sessions write in this same folder — conflicts are likely and you resolve them yourself. A Deviation is logged." },
      { label: "Abbrechen", description: "Exit now. Nothing is written: no STATE.md, no lock." },
    ],
  }],
});
```

The second working folder is a git worktree at `<basePath>/<repo-name>-<sessionId>/`; `enterWorktree()` from `scripts/lib/autopilot/worktree-pipeline.mjs` creates it (see Outcome handling below). Running in-place puts PSA-001/PSA-002/PSA-004 discipline on the operator.

### Codex CLI / Cursor IDE / Pi fallback (numbered Markdown list)

```
A <mode> session (process <pid>) started <ageHours>h ago in this same folder. Run separately or alongside?

1. Worktree anlegen + starten (Recommended) — creates a second working folder beside this one and starts there; isolates your edits, so nothing collides.
2. Manuell — in-place daneben — both sessions write in this folder; conflicts are likely and you resolve them. A Deviation is logged.
3. Abbrechen — exit now. Nothing is written: no STATE.md, no lock.

Reply with the number of your choice.
```

The two slots are `parallelPeer.mode` and `parallelPeer.pid`; `<ageHours>` is the age of that session in hours.

### Outcome handling

- **Worktree anlegen + starten** → invoke `enterWorktree({ basePath, sessionId, branch, repoRoot })` from `scripts/lib/autopilot/worktree-pipeline.mjs`. The helper creates a sibling worktree at `<basePath>/<repo-name>-<sessionId>/`, runs idempotency + boundary checks, and logs a WARN line to stderr on fresh creation. Once the worktree exists, exit the current preamble flow — the new worktree's own session-start runs from scratch (Phase 1 onwards). On failure (`WorktreeBoundaryError` or `git worktree add` non-zero exit), emit a stderr warning `parallel-aware: enterWorktree failed: <error>; falling back to Manuell` and proceed via the Manuell path.
- **Manuell** → append a Deviation via `appendDeviationOnDisk()`:
  `Worktree-Auto-Promotion declined; running in-place alongside session_id=<peer.sessionId>, mode=<peer.mode>, pid=<peer.pid>. PSA-001/PSA-002/PSA-004 discipline applies.`
  Continue Phase-0.
- **Abbrechen** → exit Phase-0 immediately. No file writes.

## Always-OK Pass-Through (no AUQ)

Fires when the caller's mode is in the `always-ok` class (`discovery`, `evolve`, `plan`, `repo-audit`, `portfolio`). The preamble returns `PASS_THROUGH` immediately regardless of other active sessions. No AUQ, no Deviation, no latency penalty.

```js
// Conceptual — there is NO AUQ for this case.
// The preamble returns { outcome: 'PASS_THROUGH', callerClass: 'always-ok', active }.
// The caller skill continues to Phase 1 unconditionally.
```

PRD §3 P1 row 5 specifies this is a hard guarantee — read-only modes never produce an interrupt.
