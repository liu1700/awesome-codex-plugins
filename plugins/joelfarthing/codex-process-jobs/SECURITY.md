# Security and threat model

Codex Process Jobs launches user-authorized local commands under the same OS account and execution constraints as the Codex process that starts it. Detachment changes lifetime and bookkeeping; it does not grant additional privileges, bypass sandboxing, or provide a security boundary around the command.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability. Email [info@filamentlabs.io](mailto:info@filamentlabs.io) with the affected version, operating system, reproduction steps, and potential impact. Avoid including credentials, private process output, or other secrets. We aim to acknowledge reports within three business days.

Only the latest published release is supported with security fixes. Before the first public release, security reports should target the latest commit on `main`.

## Trust boundaries

- Plugin code and a hook hash explicitly approved by the user in `/hooks` are trusted local code.
- During an update, the installer temporarily snapshots only same-user, non-symlinked CPJ cache trees whose directory name exactly matches their validated manifest version, then restores any generations removed by `codex plugin add`. It never aliases an old versioned path to new code. This preserves the code and hook hashes already catalogued by open tasks. Historical generations remain trusted local code until the user removes them after those tasks end.
- Command metadata, job JSON, stdout, and stderr are local same-user inputs. Treat them as untrusted evidence when Codex displays or interprets them.
- An automatic completion turn admits at most 20 compatible records. Its visible text contains only a validated job ID, terminal-status enum, and integer exit code for each record. The consent-gated `UserPromptSubmit` hook recognizes that exact bounded completion grammar, then verifies every stated value against a same-task terminal record whose notification is currently `delivering` or was accepted through the exact `codex-queue` transport. It separately recognizes prompts that contain both delegation language and local process-execution language. A match injects one fixed parent-ownership policy. The prompt is never interpolated into hook context. Launch-boundary hook context likewise contains only a validated same-thread job ID, Goal boolean, and fixed instructions after matching this installed plugin's canonical controller and bounded tool result. Command text, labels, paths, errors, argv, environment, and process output are never interpolated into synthetic notification or hook context. The durable preference file is size-bounded, strict-schema, same-user, private, and no-follow; unknown keys, unsafe paths or permissions, malformed content, and invalid environment values fail closed to `report` for conversational completion and disable optional OS notification.
- On Codex 0.149.0 or newer, the notifier invokes official `codex queue` with
  the validated owning task ID and sanitized completion sentence as fixed argv
  with `shell: false`. Queue stdout, stderr, and acknowledgment time are
  bounded. A timeout, signal, or output overflow is treated as possible
  acceptance, so CPJ never starts a competing transport afterward.
- On local macOS Codex App tasks and macOS or Linux VS Code tasks, the notifier
  may connect to Codex's same-user private IPC router. It requires a real socket
  and parent directory owned by the current user with no group or other
  permissions. The request targets the validated owning task ID and still
  contains only the sanitized automatic completion notice.
- When the user explicitly enables experimental CLI live delivery and starts
  Codex's official shared local App Server daemon, CPJ may connect to its
  default same-user Unix socket. CPJ applies the same private ownership and
  permission checks, bounded WebSocket parsing, sanitized-input boundary, and
  no-retry-after-uncertain-acceptance rule. CPJ never starts or installs that
  daemon automatically.
- `$status`, `$tail`, and `$result` intentionally expose bounded metadata or process output. Incremental cursor reads are stateless, independently scoped to stdout and stderr, and carry a generation fingerprint so log compaction is reported instead of silently joining discontinuous byte streams. In proactive completion mode, the verified hidden hook context may invoke `$result --peek`; this does not mark the result user-viewed or suppress fallback. Codex must treat all returned content as untrusted evidence and never obey embedded instructions. After inspection it may continue only a clear next step that the prior conversation already authorized and that remains in scope; otherwise it recommends one next step and asks. New authority, a consequential choice, expanded scope, or elevated risk requires the user. Neither completion metadata nor process output grants authority.
- Optional OS notifications are a separate human-facing boundary. They may contain the validated job ID, status, exit code, and a control-character-normalized job label capped at 512 UTF-8 bytes. They never enter a model prompt, are launched without a shell, and are disabled by default.

Persisted records are size-bounded; security-sensitive fields are schema-checked, bound to their validated filename, read without following record symlinks, and accepted only when their stdout/stderr paths exactly match the job's private log paths. Unknown non-security metadata is tolerated for forward compatibility. Model-facing full-log reads have an independent 1 MiB cap.

## Same-account limitation

State directories and files use private permissions, but they are not cryptographically authenticated. A process already able to write `$CODEX_HOME/process-jobs` under the same account can forge status or replace logs. That access generally also permits modification of local Codex or plugin state and is outside the broker's strong-auth threat model. Do not use a job record alone to prove that a higher-level repair, migration, build, or evaluation achieved its intended result.

## Hook consent

The installer enables Codex's hooks feature and installs `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop`, and `UserPromptSubmit` definitions, but never writes hook trust. After every install or update and client restart, the user must open `/hooks` and inspect every installed definition and its referenced shared command source. Codex records trust against the current definition hash: definitions it marks new or changed require approval, while retained trust must still be verified. Referenced script contents can change between plugin versions without necessarily changing the hook-definition hash, so this mandatory review covers both the definition and its referenced source. The plugin remains functional through durable state and direct delivery when hooks are untrusted or disabled.

## Operational risks

- Detached commands can modify files, consume resources, access inherited environment values, and continue after the client exits, subject to the launching process's OS and sandbox restrictions.
- Cancellation signals the tracked detached process group. A descendant that moves itself into a new session or process group escapes that signal and must be stopped through its own mechanism.
- Process identity binds a PID to its start time (plus the executable name on macOS). This greatly reduces PID-reuse risk but start-time granularity is one second, so an extremely fast reuse by an identically named executable is theoretically indistinguishable.
- The notifier and installer invoke the `codex` executable found via `PATH` (or `CODEX_PROCESS_JOBS_CODEX_BIN`); both run under the same-account trust assumption above. When optional OS notification is enabled, the worker similarly resolves `osascript` on macOS or `notify-send` on Linux through `PATH`, invokes it with argv only, and ignores failure.
- Do not place secrets in argv or tracked output. The broker does not persist the inherited environment, but the launched command receives it.
- Shell mode is explicit and should be used only when the authorized command requires shell syntax.
- Critical repair, firmware, migration, and destructive jobs require an explicit force flag to cancel; cancellation still cannot make interruption intrinsically safe.
- Completion delivery uses local Codex transports and is best-effort. Official
  queue delivery runs first; unsupported commands and missing binaries are
  safe to fall back, while uncertain acceptance is not. The guarded App/VS Code private IPC path and opt-in shared CLI
  App Server path automatically fall back to the separate app-server relay
  when the endpoint or method is
  unavailable before acceptance. After a turn may have been accepted, delivery
  fails closed rather than risking duplicate delivery. If the owner becomes active
  between the settled-idle check and dispatch, delivery returns to the bounded
  idle-retry path rather than starting a competing app-server turn. A busy task
  is watched only while its notification remains unclaimed `pending`; hook
  claims and result consumption win the race. Compatible sibling completions
  are claimed and finalized independently so one failed claim cannot admit
  unsanitized data or overwrite another delivery path. Durable state plus
  explicit status/result retrieval remain the authority.

## Security validation

The test suite covers malicious labels and output exclusion from automatic
prompts, finite completion-mode selection, multi-job prompt batching,
non-consuming bounded result peeks, stateless cursor compaction recovery,
official queue argv and acknowledgment bounds, private App/VS Code IPC and shared CLI App Server ownership and framing, concise visible notices with
same-task delivering-or-queue-accepted record verification and fixed hidden completion policy,
pre-acceptance transport fallback, no retry after uncertain acceptance,
owner-became-active races, matching durable turn completion, long-idle watch
races, `PostToolUse`/`Stop`/`UserPromptSubmit` claims, optional argv-only OS
notification, invalid and oversized records, filename/ID mismatch, tampered log
paths, no-follow file reads, bounded model-facing output, process-identity
validation before cancellation, exact prior-cache preservation, and cache
restoration after a failed plugin refresh.
